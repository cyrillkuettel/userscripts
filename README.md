# userscripts

User scripts are a powerful tool for users to take control of their online experience and customize websites to better suit their needs.

# How to use

1. Install a userscript manager. For example,
[Greasemonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey)

2. Open the Extension, press "Create new Script"

3. Copy the contents of the  `userscript.js` file you want to add and save the
file. (Ctrl + S)
> **Note**
> If you don't want to automatically receive updates (from this repo), you can also just not use
> the `userscript.js`. Instead copy the header from `userscript.js` and add it at
> the top of the other file. .
