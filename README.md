# userscripts

User scripts are a powerful tool for users to take control of their online experience and customize websites to better suit their needs.

# How to use

1. Install a userscript manager. For example,
[Greasemonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey)

2. Open the Extension, press "Create new Script"

3. Copy the contents of the  `userscript.js` file you want to add and save the
file. (Ctrl + S)

The advantages of this approach, is that youcan  automatically receive updates. 
(Because the script is sourced on this repository). If you don't want that, just copy the code itself into your collection..

# Ideas:
_Google auto decline cookies_
_In google searhc, when tab is first pressed, and the "Skip to main content"
appears, I want that always so just simulate a click on that_
